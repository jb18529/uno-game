# uno-game
Uno Game Group Project

Executed 100% of required tasks while leading a 4 person team to complete a university project to recreate the Uno card game using Python and the Pygame framework in 3 weeks. Developed improved visuals with a multi choice background feature and multiple computer player modes.

- Implemented an Agile approach to development, organized team meetings, and allocated tasks for each member
- Learned Pygame, developed game logic, background visuals and amalgamating code from other team members to the main branch
- Additional rule in uno game: before each turn a player must choose to get rid of one card (added to the bottom of the discard pile) and draw one card from the deck.
